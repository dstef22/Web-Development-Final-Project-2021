    This was my final project for my Intro to Web Development class.
    
    Some free images used from https://pixabay.com/ and music from https://freepd.com/world.php.
    
    DESC: My project is a website entitled "The Knight-club" which is a website that will teach you everything you need to know to become a knight. 
	This is the home page for my project website. The home page welcomes users and gives an overview of the other pages.
