    This was my final project for my Intro to Web Development class.
    
    Some free images used from https://pixabay.com/ and music from https://freepd.com/world.php.
    
    DESC: My project is a website entitled "The Knight-club" which is a website that will teach you everything you need to know to become a knight. 
	This is the "Kistory of Knights" page for my project website. This page gives a brief overview of some knight history.
