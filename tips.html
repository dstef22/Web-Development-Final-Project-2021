    This was my final project for my Intro to Web Development class.
    
    Some free images used from https://pixabay.com/ and music from https://freepd.com/world.php.
    
    DESC: My project is a website entitled "The Knight-club" which is a website that will teach you everything you need to know to become a knight. 
	This is the "Tips and Tricks" page of my project website. This page gives some basic tips to aspiring knights.

				<h1>Armor maintenance</h1>
				
				<p><em>I am not a seasoned armor expert but the basics form <a href="https://www.quora.com/Historically-what-was-the-maintenance-of-plate-armor-and-mail-Did-it-need-to-be-oiled-brushed-etc" target="_blank">Eric Lowe on Quora</a> are:</em></p>
				
				<p>Roughly speaking, every time you <em>put armor on</em>, you must:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Check your laces for missing aiguilettes.</li>
					<li>Check your straps for busted rivets or tears.</li>
					<li>Check your stitching for worn or damaged stitches.</li>
					<li>Check your plates for rust, and scrub it off if necessary.</li>
					<li>Check your mail for rust, and scrub it off if necessary.</li>
					<li>Oil every square centimeter of plate.</li>
					<li>Oil every square centimeter of mail.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>Scrubbing rust off of plate is not necessarily that bad. Tedious, and you have to avoid damaging any leather straps that are riveted to that particular plate, but straightforward. If your mail is rusting, you need to:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Cut it off of any cloth it’s attached to.</li>
					<li>Stick it in a barrel of sand, and roll that big old barrel around.</li>
					<li>Take it out of the barrel, and brush/shake all the sand out of the nooks and crannies.</li>
					<li>Re-sew it to whatever cloth it was attached to.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>And this is just for putting the stuff on, not for fighting. If you had the temerity to fight in your armor, then you almost certainly have one or more:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Cut or torn laces.</li>
					<li>Cut or torn straps.</li>
					<li>Busted rivets.</li>
					<li>Cut or torn stitches.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>There’s a certain amount of redundancy built into a suit of armor, so damage to these connective parts of the armor doesn’t necessarily make whole pieces of armor fall off or stop working. But they still need to be fixed between combats.</p>
				<p>And of course, after fighting, you might also have:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Dents in the plates themselves.</li>
					<li>Dented or busted links of mail.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>And finally a video on basic armor maintenance from Knyght Errant on youtube</strong></p>

				<h1>Swordfighting</h1>
				<p>How can you be a knight without knowing how to use a sword?</p>
				<p>As you probably know swordfighting is probably the coolest thing a knight can do.</p>
				<p>Just imagine, this could be you one day.</p>

				<p>You cannot master swordfighting on this site alone sadly.</p>However if you are interested in starting out you might start with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c32rihBSWjA" target="_blank">video on youtube.</a>
