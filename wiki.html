				<h1>Codes and Oathes</h1>
				<p><strong>Throughout history knights have pledged different oathes to different rulers. Your oath today is your own, but here are a few notable ones from history.</strong></p>
				<p><em>From <a href="https://widjiitiwin.ca/knights-honour-code-of-chivalry/" target="_blank">Widjiitiwin</a>: this was the Oath of Chivalry each of King Arthur's Knights swore.</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li>To never lay down arms</li>
					<li>To seek after wonders</li>
					<li>Not to attack one another</li>
					<li>To injure no one</li>
					<li>To fight for the safety of one’s country</li>
					<li>When called upon, to defend the rights of the weak with all one’s strength</li>
					<li>To give one’s life for one’s country</li>
					<li>To seek nothing before honour</li>
					<li>Never to break faith for any reason</li>
					<li>To practice religion most diligently</li>
					<li>To grant hospitality to anyone, each according to his ability</li>
					<li>Whether in honour or disgrace, to make a report with the greatest fidelity to truth to those who keep the annals</li>
				</ul>
				<br><br>
				
				<p><em>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalry" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>: these are Léon Gautier's Ten Commandments of chivalry</em></p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Thou shalt believe all that the Church teaches and thou shalt observe all its directions.</li>
					<li>Thou shalt defend the Church.</li>
					<li>Thou shalt respect all weaknesses, and shalt constitute thyself the defender of them.</li>
					<li>Thou shalt love the country in which thou wast born.</li>
					<li>Thou shalt not recoil before thine enemy.</li>
					<li>Thou shalt make war against the infidel without cessation and without mercy.</li>
					<li>Thou shalt perform scrupulously thy feudal duties, if they be not contrary to the laws of God.</li>
					<li>Thou shalt never lie, and shalt remain faithful to thy pledged word.</li>
					<li>Thou shalt be generous, and give largesse to everyone.</li>
					<li>Thou shalt be everywhere and always the champion of the Right and the Good against Injustice and Evil.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Fun Facts about Knights</h1>
				<p><em>Source credits <a href="https://www.chicagocostume.com/blog/7-little-known-facts-about-knights/" target="_blank">chicagocostume.com</a></em>
				
				<ol>
					<li>The word Knight derives from "cniht", an old Anglo Saxon word for "boy" or "man-at-arms.</li>
					<li>Women could be knights too. There were two ways to become a knight - holding land under a knight’s fee or being inducted into an order of knighthood. When a dead knight’s land passed to his wife or daughter, these duties were imposed on that woman. In England, the title of Lady was usually given to such a woman, but in France, Tuscany, and Romagna she was given the male title. In 1358, women finally gained full knightly acceptance in England when they began to be admitted to chivalric orders.</li>
					<li>Knighthood was not for the peasants. What was that earlier about holding land to become a knight? That's right, not anyone could become a knight. Being a knight was extremely expensive. You had to pay for your own armor, weapons, and horse. Plus you had to maintain your home and servants. </li>
					<li>There were benefits to the title. Often knights were rewarded by the kingdom with large plots of land in exchange for their military service. </li>
					<li>The benefits had strings attached. The knight had rights to rule over his fiefdom as he saw fit, but was still was a tenant of the crown. They had to be ready to fight for their country when asked. Plus they had to oversee the land and often served as judges and political advisers.</li>
					<li>It wasn't all fun and games for the young. If you were born a son to a knight, chances are you became one too. But the hard work started at a very young age requiring them to serve as a page for seven years, then as a squire for another seven years. </li>
					<li>Spiral Staircases were not designed just to save space. In medieval castles, the spiral staircases were usually located next to an outer wall. If an enemy were to trespass, the narrow curved shape made it difficult to fight while navigating the staircase. Also, the spiral design wound clockwise going up. Any invader would advance with their left side to the front, giving them a disadvantage since they almost always wielded their sword with their right hand. </li>
